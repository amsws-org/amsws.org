      <par>
        Computing competency is a quickly growing need in all facets of
        industry, engineering, research, and government.
        Anyone and everyone, regardless of their background, should have the
        ability to work with computing devices easily and efficiently.

        The American Software Society is founded on the principle that everyone
        should have this opportunity. Our staff and volunteers are here to teach
        programming principles and skills to anyone new to computing. Whether
        they are students pursuing a degree in computer science, a professional
        looking to switch to a computing career, or someone looking to
        incorporate computing principles into their current career, students and
        clients of the American Software Society receive individualized
        instruction for their needs.
